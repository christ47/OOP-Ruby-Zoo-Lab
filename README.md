# OOP-Ruby-Zoo-Lab
I created an Object Orientated Programme to familiarise myself with the use of Classes and Modules. Modules were used to group together classes which detailed the instructions and characteristics of Humans or Animals in the zoo.

I implemented the four principles of Object Orientated Programme within this work. Inheritance was used to transfer behaviour between classes. Some variables were encapsulated by being made instance variables. Abstraction was used to select specific information from large classes. Dynamic polymorphism was used to override methods.
